# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT: The iterative editing system is architecturally sound with proper edit mode detection, validation systems, and retry logic. However, the core AI generation service is non-functional due to budget constraints, making comprehensive testing impossible. CRITICAL: This is the second API key to exceed budget limits during testing. The advanced editing features cannot be validated until AI generation is restored."

ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET (6/6): 1) Website generation completed without errors (201.71s, 15907 char HTML), 2) Backend logs show CSS extraction activity with file saves (8405 chars CSS, 4018 chars JS), 3) CSS file size is substantial (8405 bytes > 1000 bytes requirement), 4) HTML properly links to external CSS file (href='static/styles.css') with no embedded <style> tags remaining (0 count), 5) Preview CSS endpoint returns 200 OK with correct content-type (text/css), 6) The black page issue is resolved - external files contain extracted content and are properly served. The file extraction system is working perfectly - embedded styles/scripts are extracted to external files, HTML is cleaned of embedded content, and preview loads with proper styling."

    message: "✅ FORMAT SPECIFIER FIX TESTING COMPLETE! Tested the format specifier fix that resolves repetitive website generation issue. ALL SUCCESS CRITERIA MET (6/6): 1) No 'Invalid format specifier' errors found in backend logs, 2) Both generations completed successfully (E-commerce: 'StepStyle - Premium Shoe Store', Portfolio: 'Alexandra Chen - Photography Portfolio'), 3) Intent analysis working properly - backend logs show proper JSON analysis for each request, 4) Generated websites have DIFFERENT titles (not both 'VideoTube'), 5) HTML file sizes are different (E-commerce: 4897 chars, Portfolio: 2409 chars), 6) Content matches request types - E-commerce has shopping-related content (shoe, store, cart), Portfolio has photography-related content (photo, portfolio, gallery). The format specifier fix (changing pipe characters | to 'OR' in _analyze_user_intent method) successfully resolves the repetitive website generation issue. Generation times were appropriate (3+ minutes each) indicating real AI processing, not fallback templates."

    message: "❌ ADVANCED EDITING SYSTEM TEST FAILED - BUDGET EXCEEDED AGAIN! Attempted comprehensive testing of the iterative editing system as requested in review, but encountered the same budget exhaustion issue that was previously resolved. Current status: 1) AI Service Budget: EXCEEDED (cost: $9.02, limit: $8.60), 2) Website Generation: FAILING - all requests return VideoTube fallback template (15907 chars) instead of requested content, 3) Iterative Editing: CANNOT TEST - initial generation fails, so editing functionality cannot be validated, 4) Backend API Endpoints: ✅ WORKING (session creation, file serving), 5) Edit Mode Detection: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (code shows proper edit-only mode enforcement), 6) Edit Validation System: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (retry logic, regeneration detection). The advanced editing system implementation appears architecturally sound based on code review, but the core AI generation service is non-functional due to budget constraints. CRITICAL: The same Emergent LLM API key (sk-emergent-a5cFe97DfDa9871F4E) that was working before has now exceeded its budget again. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Use web search tool to find solution for budget increase or alternative API key to restore AI generation functionality and enable proper testing of the advanced editing system."

    message: "❌ CRITICAL BUDGET ISSUE CONFIRMED - UPDATED API KEY ALSO EXHAUSTED! Comprehensive testing attempted with the new API key (sk-emergent-57c22C4B89b1e61B09) provided in review request, but discovered this key has also exceeded its budget limit. Backend logs show: 'Budget has been exceeded! Current cost: 1.0752660000000003, Max budget: 1.0'. Testing results: 1) Session Creation API: ✅ WORKING (200 OK responses), 2) Website Generation API: ❌ FAILING - all requests timeout or return 502 errors due to budget exhaustion, 3) AI Service: ❌ NON-FUNCTIONAL - budget exceeded error prevents any AI generation, 4) Backend Architecture: ✅ SOUND - code review shows proper edit mode detection, validation systems, and retry logic are implemented, 5) Advanced Editing Features: ❌ CANNOT TEST - initial generation fails due to AI service budget constraints. WEB SEARCH CONDUCTED: Found that Emergent LLM API budget limits can be increased by clicking the + icon in chat interface (max 500 credits per task) or by contacting support for larger budgets. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Either increase budget for existing API key via Emergent dashboard, obtain new API key with higher budget, or implement alternative AI provider to restore functionality and enable comprehensive testing of the advanced editing system."

    message: "❌ ADVANCED EDITING SYSTEM TEST IMPOSSIBLE - PERSISTENT BUDGET EXHAUSTION! Attempted comprehensive testing of the advanced editing system as requested in review, but the AI service remains non-functional due to budget constraints. CURRENT STATUS: 1) API Key Status: sk-emergent-57c22C4B89b1e61B09 EXHAUSTED (cost: $1.08, limit: $1.00), 2) Backend Services: ✅ OPERATIONAL (session creation, file serving, preview endpoints working), 3) AI Generation: ❌ COMPLETELY FAILED - all website generation requests timeout or fail due to budget exceeded errors, 4) Advanced Editing Tests: ❌ CANNOT EXECUTE - Phase 1 (initial website generation) fails, preventing testing of ADD/REMOVE/MODIFY features, 5) Edit Mode Detection: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - code review confirms proper edit-only mode enforcement, 6) Validation Systems: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - regeneration detection, retry logic, and blank screen prevention in place. ARCHITECTURAL ASSESSMENT: The iterative editing system implementation is comprehensive and well-designed with proper edit mode detection, validation systems, and retry mechanisms. However, without functional AI generation, the advanced editing capabilities cannot be tested or validated. RECOMMENDATION: This task requires web search to find solution for budget increase or alternative AI provider before comprehensive testing can proceed."
